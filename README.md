# Fake News Detection

Fake News Detection in Python

In this project, we have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using sci-kit libraries from python. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

1. Python 3.6 
2. You will also need to download and install below 3 packages after you install either python or anaconda from the steps above
   - Sklearn (scikit-learn)
   - numpy
   - scipy
   
### Installing and steps to run the software


1. Download this git repository.
2. In CMD change the directory to the folder where this project is saved in your machine and type below command and press enter.
3. Link to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o0V9swp9sHay2xyW5wpv9XRIL3UoHshS/view?usp=sharing" > training CSV</a>
  
  ```
  python predict.py
  ```
   
  - After hitting the enter, program will ask for an input which will be the URL of the news that you want to verify, then press enter.
